3. Maintain the original language where possible, providing direct quotes with page references
4. Do not fabricate information - if details for a section are not present, indicate "Not specified in the document"
5. For complex sections, create hierarchical structures (bullet points, numbered lists)
6. Aim for comprehensiveness while maintaining clarity

## CSV FORMATTING GUIDELINES

1. Use comma-separated values format
2. Each row MUST contain EXACTLY THREE columns: Section,Subsection,Content
3. NEVER include commas in the Section or Subsection fields
4. All commas MUST be part of the Content field only
5. If you need to include commas in content, make sure they're in the third column only
6. Format dates consistently (YYYY-MM-DD)
7. Use semicolons to separate multiple items within a cell
8. IMPORTANT: Replace all newlines in content with semicolons (;) to prevent creating new rows
9. If page references are available, include them in the Content field at the end in parentheses, e.g., "Content details (Page 5)"
10. Example format:
Section,Subsection,Content
RFP IDENTIFICATION,RFP issuer,City of Hallandale Beach (Page 1)

## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Always begin your response with the CSV header row
2. Ensure all fields are properly escaped and formatted
3. Replace all newlines in content with semicolons to maintain single-row format
4. If you're uncertain about any specific section or information, indicate this clearly rather than making assumptions
